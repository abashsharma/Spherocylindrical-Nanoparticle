# 3D Meshing
Meshing is the process of dividing a geometric domain into smaller, discrete elements—such as triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra, or hexahedra—that can be used for numerical simulations. It is a critical step in finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and other computational modeling techniques. A well-constructed mesh captures the geometry and physical behavior of a system accurately while balancing computational cost and numerical stability.

# Spherocylindrical-Nanoparticle
Spherocylindrical nanoparticles are anisotropic particles shaped like cylinders with hemispherical end caps—essentially a hybrid between a sphere and a rod. Their elongated geometry gives rise to unique physical, chemical, and self-assembly properties that differ significantly from spherical particles. These nanoparticles are studied in contexts ranging from colloidal physics and liquid crystal phases to drug delivery and nanocomposite materials, where their shape plays a key role in determining interactions, packing behavior, and phase transitions.


# Code Schematics
This code generates a Spherocylindrical NP of Radius,R and Aspect Ratio, AR. \
In order to generate the vertices, compile the  SCNP.cpp. The executable file requires the desired radius and Aspect Ratio of the 3D geometry.

# Usage
SCNP is a executable file which can be executed as: \
./SCNP.out radius AR

# Output
Once the code is run, it outputs a .xyz file, containing the vertices of the NP.
