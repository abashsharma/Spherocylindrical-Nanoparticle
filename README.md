# Spherocylindrical-Nanoparticle
This code generates a Spherocylindrical NP of Radius,R and Aspect Ratio, AR.
In order to generate the vertices, compile the  SCNP.cpp. The executable file requires the desired radius and Aspect Ratio of the NP. Once the code is run, it outputs a VMD (.xyz) files withthe vertices of the NP.

SCNP is a executable file which can be executed as:
./SCNP.out radius AR
