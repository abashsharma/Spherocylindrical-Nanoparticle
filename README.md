# Spherocylindrical-Nanoparticle
This code generates a Spherocylindrical NP of Radius,R and Aspect Ratio, AR. \
In order to generate the vertices, compile the  SCNP.cpp. The executable file requires the desired radius and Aspect Ratio of the NP. 

# Code Schematics
<img src="SCNP.png" alt="Plot" width="800"/>


# Usage
SCNP is a executable file which can be executed as: \
./SCNP.out radius AR

# Output
Once the code is run, it outputs a .xyz file, containing the vertices of the NP.
